# Arduino Keypad Interface

## Description

This project demonstrates how to interface a 4x3 keypad with an Arduino to capture key presses and display them on the Serial Monitor. The keypad is connected to the Arduino, and each key press is detected and sent to the Serial Monitor.

## Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO**
2. **4x3 Keypad**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **Breadboard**

## Diagram

*I will update the block diagram with a logo or watermark ASAP. Please leave it for now.*

## Instructions

### Connecting the Components

1. **Input Sensor to Controller:**
   - Connect the keypad's row pins to Arduino digital pins 9, 8, 7, and 6.
   - Connect the keypad's column pins to Arduino digital pins 5, 4, and 3.

### Power the Arduino

- Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.

### Upload the Code and Observe the Data

1. **Load the Program:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Write or paste the provided program into the IDE.
   - Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE under the Tools menu.
   - Upload the program to the Arduino.

2. **Monitor the Output:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE by selecting Tools > Serial Monitor.
   - Set the baud rate to 9600 in the Serial Monitor.
   - Press keys on the keypad and observe the corresponding key values being printed on the Serial Monitor.

### Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The Arduino initializes serial communication at 9600 baud.

- **Reading Key Presses:**
  - The keypad library detects key presses and returns the value of the pressed key.
  - The detected key value is printed on the Serial Monitor.

## Applications

1. **User Input Interface:** Used in projects where numeric or character input is required.
2. **Access Control Systems:** Incorporated into systems requiring a keypad for entering passwords or codes.
3. **Menu Navigation:** Used in devices to navigate through menu options.

## Observe the Data

To read data from the keypad, you need to upload the sketch to the Arduino. After connecting the Arduino to your computer and uploading the program, you should see the key presses displayed on the Serial Monitor, confirming the keypad's functionality.
